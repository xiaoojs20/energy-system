Introduction to AI final project. 

China is rich in renewable energy resources, and the power system with wind, solar and hydro energy as the main energy sources is the future development form of energy and electricity in China, but renewable energy sources have the shortcomings of intermittency and volatility, and the high proportion of renewable energy penetration poses new challenges to the safe and stable operation of the power system. Microgrid (MG) mainly consists of distributed generators (DG) and energy storage system (ESS) to supply power to the load. To improve the reliability of renewable energy supply in MG, an aggregated system with multiple battery energy storage devices is defined as a battery energy storage system (BESS). BESSs store surplus power from RESs and then release the power to customers when needed . There is also the challenge of buying and selling power between microgrid customers, which BESS can also solve.

Therefore, this coursework hopes to use this as a starting point in order to try to solve some AI-related problems in integrated landscape storage systems.

- Power generation side: prediction of DC power in PV output, simulation of DC power in wind power.

- Energy storage side: life prediction of battery monomer, life prediction of battery storage system.

- User side: prediction of user power consumption, clustering of user power consumption patterns.
